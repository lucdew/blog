I decided to no longer post on my blog due to a serious lack of motivation, time and inspiring topics ;-). Of course, comments will now be closed.As a side note here are the titles of drafts that never turned into posts:-  Difficulty of choosing a Java web framework
-  Seam managed persistence context and Spring
-  Bye Bye computer book shelf
-  Drools flow or jBPM4 ?
-  Ejb3 on JBoss with Maven
-  Creating a Spring based library (with its own context)
-  Au revoir Windows vista
