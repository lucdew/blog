<br />Nice slides of a presentation of [Weblogic](http://edocs.bea.com/wls/docs81/notes/issues.html "Known issues") server 9.0 made duringJavapolis 2004 are available on-line.<br />I have discovered some new features like deployment planswhich can be useful when you need to support manyconfiguration environments: test, integration, qualification and productionwithout having to unjar and modify the deployment descriptors.<br />Some new features are purely technical and useless : like the usage of XMLschema for the config.xml or the usage of log4j as the logging framework.<br />For developers, the integration of Webservices Metadata looks nice.BTW, this feature is more tied to the usage of J2SDK 5.0 metadata .<br /> Many new features on the JMS stack look promising and make the [Weblogic](http://edocs.bea.com/wls/docs81/notes/issues.html "Known issues")JMS server more attractive as a MOM on its own like Websphere MQ or Sonic MQ.See [http://www.javapolis.com/](http://www.javapolis.com/) ( u need to register)<br />BTW, merry christmas !<br />
