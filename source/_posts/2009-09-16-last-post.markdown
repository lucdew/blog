I decided to no longer post on my blog due to a serious lack of motivation, time and inspiring topics ;-). Of course, comments will now be closed. As a side note here are the titles of drafts that never turned into posts:

*  Difficulty of choosing a Java web framework
*  Seam managed persistence context and Spring
*  Bye Bye computer book shelf
*  Drools flow or jBPM4 ?
*  Ejb3 on JBoss with Maven
*  Creating a Spring based library (with its own context)
*  Au revoir Windows vista

<span style="color: red">Update January 4th 2012 : Migrated blog to github.com, revamped it. It is now powered by octopress and statically generated (it used to be fueled by Wordpress) </span>
