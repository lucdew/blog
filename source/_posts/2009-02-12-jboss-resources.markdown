I recently discovered 2 good web sites that provide good JBoss knowledge :

* [Master the boss](http://www.mastertheboss.com) : especially with articles with jBPM/JBoss ESB integration, jBPM best practices and JBoss AS tuning (a little bit outdated by the way, but still a good resource).
* [Enterprise BPM blog](http://enterprisebpm.blogspot.com/) : blog by a Redhat engineer involved in jBPM and WS-BPEL jBPM implementation. It has also links to other jBPM related sites.
