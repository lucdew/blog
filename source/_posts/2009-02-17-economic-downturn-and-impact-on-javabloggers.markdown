I wanted to know if the economic crisis had an impact on blogging. I was curious because it seemed for me that the blogs that i usually follow had less activityÂ  . With the help of a groovy script and gchart, here's the last 2 years monthly blog posts count (don't know why there's a high peak for July 07). It seems that, so far, java bloggers still post.![](http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=lc&chs=600x500&chtt=Javablogs+monthly+posts+count%20+%7C+since+01-01-2007+to+01-02-2009&chxt=x,y&chxr=1,0,15000&chds=0,15000&chd=t:4224,4133,4758,4474,5561,4933,14719,5155,4515,5301,5047,4862,5341,3975,5278,3826,5527,4271,4471,4305,4548,4480,4347,4993,4520&chxl=0:%7C1-07%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C5%7C6%7C7%7C8%7C9%7C10%7C11%7C12%7C1-08%7C2%7C3%7C4%7C5%7C6%7C7%7C8%7C9%7C10%7C11%7C12%7C1-09)
For the quality of the blog posts that's another story but my blog is not a good example ;-)
