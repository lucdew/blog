(Seen on jBPM mailing-list): a quite interesting study between the non-exhaustive Java BPM engines (jBPM, enhydra shark, openwfe) has been published. Follow this [link](http://www.workflowpatterns.com/documentation/documents/BPM-07-12.pdf).Updated 2008/08 : The report has been updated (see [http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/08/oswf](http://www.infoq.com/news/2008/08/oswf))
