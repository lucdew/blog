This comic sums up my opinion on Scala pretty well (very funny):[http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2008/01/02/scala-will-do/](http://stuffthathappens.com/blog/2008/01/02/scala-will-do/)I jumped on Ruby and Rails bandwagon spending some man-days (;-)) on it but at least Rails has been a reference in term of web productivity and introduced or leveraged nice concepts (naming conventions over configuration, DSL, REST, TDD etc.) . Recently, many Java web frameworks compared themselves to Rails and how they were much better (Seam,Grails &amp; Co). Rails influenced the IT community (Java, .Net and Python included).=&gt; All in all, i have excuses to have followed the crowd...  But not this time, Scala (pretty unreadable), JavaFx (not until i see [the consumer jre](http://weblogs.java.net/blog/chet/archive/2007/05/consumer_jre_le.html) in action and applets as fast-loaded as flash apps without dumb dialog boxes) are definitely on my 2008 technos of no-interest !I'll hopefully focus this year on the new Cobol ;-) core (or even .Net/C#) .
