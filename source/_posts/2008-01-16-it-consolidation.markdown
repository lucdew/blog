Todays news:**Oracle buys BEA.****Mysql AB acquired by Sun.**Well what's next? Redhat acquired by Sun (or even Microsoft), Adobe acquired by Oracle, etc ?Industralization of the IT sector seems to get some steam, surely a sign of maturity. I am not sure if it will have an impact on innovation or this trend is the result of a loss of innovation. Big actors want to provide a complete enterprise stack from hardware to software package solutions. Will we only have to deal with SAP, Oracle, IBM, Sun and Microsoft tomorrow ?Google strategy seems to differentiate and focus on online services.
