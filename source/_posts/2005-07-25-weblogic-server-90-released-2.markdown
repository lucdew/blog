I haven't seen any special announcement neither  on theserverside.com (too late a annoucement has been published)  nor on javalobby.org but it seems that Weblogic server 9.0 a.k.a "Diablo" has been released. At least it can be downloaded from dev2dev.bea.com since 07/22

I was waiting for it actively because it runs on Java 5, it's J2EE 1.4 certified and needed to port some Tomcat 5.5 applications on it.
